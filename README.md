# QLearning_Cpp
In this work, we are focusing on the basics of reinforcement learning. This is a C++ implementation of Q learning which is one of the most used off policy methods.

Q-Table is a way for a lookup where we calculate the maximum expected future reward for actions at each state. (select the best action at each state)

To learn each value of the Q-table, we use the **Q-Learning algorithm**.
